# Spring is lightweight

Spring does not require Java EE ap server

Spring is not **invasive** - you write POJO, no need to extend Spring interfaces

# Spring is a container

Spring instantiates and dependency inject your objects <br />
Spring is lifecycle manager

# Spring is framework

Spring provides framework classes to simplify working with low-level technologies <br />
Spring provides comprehensive infrastructural support for developing enterprise JavaTM applications <br />
Spring key principles are **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and **SoCs** (Separation od Concerns) <br />
Spring supports assembling an application from its parts (POJO components)
- parts do not need to find other parts
- parts are very easy to swap
